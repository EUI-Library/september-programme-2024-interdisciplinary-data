## Data discovery

----

### EUI Library Data Portal

[Data Portal](https://www.eui.eu/Research/Library/ResearchGuides/Economics/Statistics/DataPortal)

----

### Challenges we face
- How do we avoid losing our work?
- How do we avoid losing the history of our work?
- How do we make sure my future self understands our current work (and the process that went into it)?
- How do we make sure that others can understand our work and can validate it?
- How can we plan everything so we do not forget?

----

### Plan, plan, and then... act!

- Plan your research (thoroughly)
- Plan how to curate data, sources & code (and revise accordingly)
- Plan how to 
- Plan how to maximize impact of your scholarly assets

---

## The basics of safeguarding your scholarly assets

----

## Do not keep your research __only__ on your laptop
<img src="img/laptop.jpg" alt="isolated" width="60%"/>

----

### Tools at the EUI

----

## ...now let's stop with the basics...

---

## How to keep track of changes and why it matters

----
### Is OneDrive enough for you?

OneDrive may very well be enough for you, but...
- Microsoft versioning is quite rudimental and not transparent
- You can go back up to a certain point, and if you make changes you lose your previous way forward
- There is no way to add "messages" about where you stand
- You still have to rely on file naming conventions for proper versioning

----
### Brief excursus on file naming conventions
- __Vocabulary__: choose a standard vocabulary for file names so that everyone uses and common language.

- __Punctuation__: decide on conventions for symbols, capitals, hyphens and spaces.

- __Dates__:  agree on a logical use e.g., YYYYMMDD.

- __Order__: confirm which element should go first, etc.

- __Numbers__: specify the number of digits that will be used in numbering.

----

### However, do you recognise yourself?

![PhD comic: "Final".doc - files are called: Final.doc, Final_rev.2.doc, FINAL_rev.6.COMMENTS.doc, FINAL_rev.8.commens5.CORRECTIONS.doc, FINAL_rev.18.comment7.corrections9.MORE.30.doc, FINAL_rev.22.comments49.corrections.10.WHYDIDICOMETOGRADSCHOOL.doc](img/phd101212s_small.gif)

----
### The solution: version control systems

* We can record who made which changes, and when
* We can revert to previous versions
* We can identify and correct conflicts (e.g. possible overwriting)
* Nothing that is *committed* is *ever* lost (unless you try hard…)

**Version control is like an unlimited ‘undo/redo’.**

> This is basis for code development, but can be applied also to research!

---

## Version control with `git` and `GitHub`

----
### Don't be scared...

![XKCD comic - A: This is git. It tracks collaborative work on projects through a beautiful distributed graph theory tree mode; B: Cool. How do we use it?; A: No idea. Just memorise these shell commands and type them to sync up. If you get errors, save your work elsewhere, delete the project, and download a fresh copy.](img/git.png)

----

### How version control works

Version control is like a 'recording' of history

![Three documents. The first has two paragraphs. The second has a modified paragraph. The third has an additional paragraph](img/play-changes.png)

...Rewind and play changes back again!

----

### What version control systems do

* Version control systems manage this process
   * track changes
   * store metadata (who, when)
   * record 'versions' (a.k.a. *commits*)
* The complete history of *commits* and metadata is a *repository*

----

### Core `git` concepts: init / add / commit
 
* You initialize a (local) repository within a folder (`git init`)
* You create/modify a file in the folder & save it
* You add the file to *staging area* (`git add`)
* You commit changes (`git commit -m "my change"`)

----

### The staging area

* We don't always want to commit all changes
* The *staging area* holds changes we want to commit
  * (other files may also be changed, but we don't want to commit them)

![On the left is a modified document. On the right is a zone representing the data stored in `.git`. In that zone are two containers: a staging area, and a repository. Using `git add` places the document into the staging area. Using `git commit` moves the document from the staging area into the repository](img/git-staging-area.png)

----

### Not command line fans? There are apps!

![GitHub Studio](img/github-studio.png)

[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

----

### ... and there are integrations!

----

### Whats is GitHub?

* Cloud service for `git`
* Replicate, backup your repositories in the cloud
* Sync across multiple computers
* Visualize changes in an intuitive way

## Brief on managing image collections

If you are managing image collections as data consider using __Tropy__
* Built with research in mind
* Build, manage and organize your image library
* Describe your sources, annotate your photos

> Download [Tropy](https://tropy.org/) and watch the EUI Library training on YoyTube: ["Introduction to Tropy"](https://youtu.be/yuxlkRlFwhI?si=g2MppxeMhU2csgxx)

## Research data and their curation

----

### What is Research Data Management?

__Research Data Management (RDM)__ is a general term that covers how you organize, structure, store, and care for the information used or generated during a research project.

![Research Data Lifecucle](img/LDW--general.png)

> Research data are becoming first-class citizens in the scholarly communication landscape!

----

### Principles of RDM
* General principles, the __FAIR principles__:

![FAIR principles of RDM](img/FAIR.png)

> Best practices and tool to make your data FAIR: [FAIRsFAIR Project](https://www.fairsfair.eu/tools-software)

----

### Data Management Plans (DMPs)

__Data Management Plans (DMPs)__ are documents that describe:
* How data is generated used, elaborated and organised
* How data, and data subjects, are protected
* How data, code and ancillary elements are described and documented
* How data is stored and secured, and how long it will be retained
* How dataset authorship and credit are assigned
* How data is preserved and under what terms, can be shared

> [EUI Data Management Plans guidelines](https://www.eui.eu/research/library/researchdataservices#DATAMANAGEMENT)

----

### Personal and sensitive data

* The collection, use, analysis  of data that include personal and sensitive informationabout human subjects are bound to the __General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)__
* __Informed consent__ is the key to all you can do
* Personal and sensitive data cannot be shared openly if not __Anonymized__ of __Pseudonymised__ 

> EUI information, resources and procedures here:
>  * [The Research Data Lifecycle](https://www.eui.eu/Research/Library/ResearchDataServices/StepByStep)
> * [Ethics and Integrity in Academic Research](https://www.eui.eu/ServicesAndAdmin/DeanOfStudies/Ethics-and-Integrity-in-Academic-Research)

----

### Anonymisation

* Remove personal data identifiers (names, postcodes, workplaces, telephone numbers &c.)
* Aggregate, or reduce, the precision of variables, eg: year of birth rather than birth date
* Use a general level of geo-coding
* Timing of anonymisation:
  * At time of data collection
  * During elaboration (data processing)
  * Public version of data can be created

> Fully anonimised data (to the best of one's knowledge) do not fall anymore under GDPR constraints

----

### Pseudonymisation

* Provide justification for why data are not anonymised (eg. follow-up wave of survey)
* Replace personal identifiers (such as names) with unique identifiers (codes)
* Store/encrypt pseudonyms separately

> Pseudonymised data can be anonymised by destroying code files and decryption key. Data should be deleted at end of retention period.

---

## A note on transparency, reproducibility and trust

----

### What contributes to building trust in your research?

_"be as open as possible, and as closed as necessary"_

* The (open) availability of your papers, your data, and your code and their changes over time (e.g. on __GitHub__)
  * Consider submitting to [Cadmus, the EUI Research Repository](https://cadmus.eui.eu/) (or a disciplinary one)
* Your DMPs
* Your research plan (e.g. a Study Pre-Registration)

> ["Transparency, Reproducibility and Impact: Placing Open Science Into Practice"](https://www.eui.eu/Documents/Research/Library/PublishingAndOpenScience/Intro-to-Open-Science-20231025.pdf), Simone Sacchi, CIVICA Training, 25 October 2023

---

## Conclusion and wrap-up

----

### On (Digital) scholarly assets

* Physical objects persist through time and decay (relatively) slowly if the physical environment is appropriate (temperature, light, etc.)

* Digital objects are much more “fragile”: they rely on physical media for storage, computational resources and applications for their appropriate access and use and suffer “technology obsolescence” 

> Both share the issue that without proper (recorded) contextual information their “intellectual content” may be lost over time (Rosetta Stone, anyone?)

----

### What we learned today

* Care, care, care about your scholary assets
* Think about your future self as your first and foremost collaborator
* Everything you produce has potential future value for you, for the academic community and society
* There are practices and tools that can help along the way
